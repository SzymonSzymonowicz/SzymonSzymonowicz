# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Szymon and I currently work as a backend developer that mainly operates in Java, Spring Boot and related projects.

I've also learned on my own glimpses of frontent development using frameworks and libraries like Vue or React.

I'm open for new challenges and eager to learn new technologies. :fire:
